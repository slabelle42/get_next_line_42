# 42 Project : Get_next_line

The function get_next_line allows you to read a file line by line.

Disclaimer: *There are simple ways of doing this using standard C functions, but the goal here is to be able to do it by only using the functions from the libft and the standard functions read, malloc and free.*

## Usage

Download the project :
```
  git clone https://github.com/slabelle42/get_next_line.git
```
